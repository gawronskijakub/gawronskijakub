# ðŸ‘‹ Hi and hello, Iâ€™m Jakub

I am a student of Information Technology eager to learn new things.


ðŸ‘€ I am interested especially in the **Frontend** and related stuff. Besides that, I also like drawing, playing video games, LEGO bricks, staying organized, and constant developing myself.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning technologies related to the Frontend like advanced use of the JavaScript, and the React library. Alongside these, I'm also sharpening my skills in HTML and CSS (SCSS).
